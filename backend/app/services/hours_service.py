"""Shared engine-hours read helpers (used by dashboard + vehicle-detail routes).

The ONE canonical helper for "current hours" — see the hours-usage-model plan
§1. Every consumer (detail-stats, hero/card, reminders, widget, analytics,
PDF) calls this; none may re-derive "latest" differently. Latest hours is
derived at read time from ``hours_records`` — there is no cache column to
keep consistent (``vehicles.current_hours`` is retired as a read source).

    """Upsert TODAY's manual engine-hours reading, idempotently (R2-H1).

    Retires ``vehicles.current_hours`` as a write target — the vehicle
    create/update flow (``services/vehicle_service.py``) intercepts a
    submitted ``current_hours`` value out of its setattr path and calls this
    instead, so the reading lands in the authoritative ``hours_records``
    history that :func:`latest_engine_hours_and_date` derives "current" from,
    rather than a dead column nothing reads for display anymore.

    Locates the existing manual row for this vin dated today — ``source ==
    'manual'`` with BOTH ``fuel_record_id`` and ``service_visit_id`` null,
    the same identity a fuel/service-synced row (``app.utils.hours_sync``)
    never carries — and updates its ``engine_hours`` in place. A repeated
    call the SAME day (e.g. two vehicle updates in one session) updates that
    ONE row rather than creating a second: at most one manual row per vin
    per day, in the common case. Creates one when absent.

    The manual-hours CRUD endpoint (``POST /api/vehicles/{vin}/hours``) has
    no same-day uniqueness guard, so more than one matching row CAN exist by
    the time this upsert runs. Tolerate that: order by ``id DESC`` and take
    the newest match with ``.scalars().first()`` rather than
    ``scalar_one_or_none()``, which raises ``MultipleResultsFound`` (an
    unhandled 500 on the vehicle-update path) the moment a second manual row
    for today exists.

    Args:
        commit: When True, commits and refreshes within its own unit of
            work. When False (the default — vehicle create/update composes
            this into their own transaction) only flushes, so the row is
            visible to the caller's own commit.

    Returns:
        The created or updated ``HoursRecord``.
