"""Backfill fuel_records.price_basis on rows the importer left NULL (#128).

``price_basis`` names the denominator ``price_per_unit`` is measured against.
Migration 053 introduced the column and populated every row that existed then,
and the record form has always set it — but neither import path (CSV nor JSON
backup) ever did, so every fill-up brought in by an import landed with
``price_basis = NULL``.

That matters because the frontend's ``priceToDisplay`` converts a stored price
into the user's units ONLY when the basis reads ``per_volume``; given NULL it
returns the value untouched. On an imperial account the canonical per-litre
figure was therefore rendered under a "Price/Gal" heading — $2.50/gal was
stored correctly as $0.660/L and then displayed as "0.66".

Fixing the importer stops new rows being created that way but does nothing for
data already imported, which for the reporter is the entire 15-year history
they migrated in. This backfills it.

The CASE is migration 053's rule unchanged, expressed on the metric column
names 053 left behind (``liters``/``propane_liters``/``kwh`` rather than
``gallons``/``propane_gallons``). Scoped to rows that have a price and no
basis: a row without a price has no denominator to name, and a row that
already has one is either correct or a deliberate user choice — neither is
ours to overwrite. That scoping also makes it idempotent, since a second run
matches nothing.

NOT FATAL: no model declares ``price_basis`` non-nullable and every reader
treats it as optional, so a failure here degrades to the pre-existing display
bug rather than booting the app against a schema it cannot use.

Dialect-agnostic: a plain ``UPDATE ... CASE ... WHERE`` valid on both SQLite
and PostgreSQL, so no dialect branch is needed (contrast migration 054).
