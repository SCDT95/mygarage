"""Re-key all telemetry param_key values to the UPPERCASE canonical, merging
casing duplicates created by the historical MQTT(upper)/HTTPS(case-preserving)
split. Uppercase wins on collision.

Canonical form mirrors ``app.utils.autopid_normalizer.canonical_param_key``
exactly: ``key.upper().replace(" ", "_")`` == SQL ``REPLACE(UPPER(key), ' ', '_')``.

Three tables (``vehicle_telemetry``, ``vehicle_telemetry_latest``,
``livelink_parameters``) use a DROP+REKEY strategy: at each table's unique
"slot", every casing variant of a PID is collapsed to ONE survivor via a
window-function group-collapse keyed on ``(slot…, canonical_key)`` (an
already-canonical/uppercase row wins the survivor slot; ties fall back to the
lowest id), then survivors are re-keyed up. Collapsing ALL-but-one per group —
not just a mixed row that happens to have an exact canonical twin — is what
makes the subsequent blanket rekey collision-free: two *distinct* non-canonical
casings of the same PID at one slot (e.g. ``51-FuelType`` + ``51-fueltype``,
neither equal to ``51-FUELTYPE``) would otherwise both rekey up and violate the
UNIQUE slot. Dropping is acceptable here because those rows are reproducible
(raw/latest telemetry, re-discovered parameter rows).

``telemetry_daily_summary`` is handled SEPARATELY with a RE-AGGREGATION merge
(NOT drop): it is the durable long-term analytics record that survives raw
telemetry pruning, so a colliding day's aggregates must be merged, never
discarded. The merge runs row-wise in Python (the table is tiny — one row per
vin/param/date) to avoid gnarly dialect-portable weighted-average SQL.

Idempotent, dialect-aware (PostgreSQL + SQLite). HEAVY on vehicle_telemetry —
back up the DB first (see Task 10 deploy note). Forward-only.
