"""Backfill-normalize existing vehicle fuel types.

Why now: Task 1 (commit ``1c66f27``) added a normalizing validator on
``VehicleCreate``/``VehicleUpdate`` (``app/constants/fuel.py``'s
``normalize_fuel_type()``), so every *new* write to ``vehicles.fuel_type``
/ ``vehicles.fuel_type_secondary`` lands canonical. Rows written before
that validator existed may still carry mixed-case values (``"Diesel"``)
or aliases (``"Gas"``) — this migration backfills those in place using
the same vocabulary current at write time.

For a *migration* it's fine to import ``normalize_fuel_type`` from the
app: this normalizes data using the live vocabulary, which is the
intent (unlike migration 062's param-class mapping, which is explicitly
required to freeze its own copy).

For each row: normalize ``fuel_type`` and ``fuel_type_secondary``; write
back only when the normalized value differs from the stored one.
Unrecognized values (no match in the normalization map) are left
untouched and printed as a warning — they simply won't satisfy any
capability gate, which is a safe default. NULL and empty-string values
are left untouched. Idempotent by construction (second run changes
nothing), dialect-aware (SQLite + PostgreSQL), guarded against the
``vehicles`` table being absent.
