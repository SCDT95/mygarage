"""Add per-account light/dark theme preference (theme) to user settings.

Adds a per-user UI theme ('light' or 'dark'). Display-only — a CSS class choice
with no bearing on stored data. Mirrors the accent_color pattern (migrations
078/081) but is added nullable from the start (no DB DEFAULT): NULL = the user
has never explicitly picked a theme, so the client's localStorage seed / default
wins and useThemeSync must NOT override it. A non-null value is an explicit
choice that syncs across devices. The ``User`` model declares it
``Mapped[str | None]``, so the ORM always sends an explicit value on insert
(NULL when unset), and the theme toggle's PUT /auth/me stores an explicit value.

FATAL: the ``User`` model declares ``theme`` and reads it on every auth path (it
is serialized in the ``UserResponse`` returned by ``/auth/me``). The migration
runner log-and-continues on non-FATAL failure (``database.py``; there is no
``strict_migrations`` enforcement), so a silent failure would boot the app
against a missing column and every user query would raise. Halting startup is
the correct behavior for a column the model hard-depends on.
