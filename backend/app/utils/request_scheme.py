    """Resolve the effective scheme (http/https) from request context.

    Checks X-Forwarded-Proto first (set by reverse proxies like Traefik/nginx),
    then falls back to request.url.scheme from the ASGI server.

    Trust model:
        X-Forwarded-Proto is trusted by default. Spoofing this header on a
        direct HTTP connection can only cause self-denial-of-service (cookie
        gets Secure=True, browser drops it). It cannot weaken security because
        setting the Secure flag "too high" never exposes cookies — it only
        prevents them from being stored.

    Defensive parsing:
        - Lowercased and stripped
        - Comma-separated values: first value wins (leftmost = client-facing proxy)
        - Only "https" is accepted as truthy; everything else resolves to "http"

    Args:
        request: The incoming FastAPI/Starlette request.

    Returns:
        "https" if HTTPS is detected, "http" otherwise.

    For URLs that must be usable *outside* the browser session that fetched
    them — an OIDC redirect the IdP will call back, or an ingest URL a user
    pastes into Torque Pro or a WiCAN dongle. Those cannot be relative.

    Mirrors the OIDC resolution (#107): X-Forwarded-Proto/Host first, since
    behind Cloudflare Tunnel or Traefik the request's own URL is the internal
    one, then the Host header, then whatever the ASGI server reports.

    Trust model: `Host`/`X-Forwarded-Host` are attacker-influenceable in
    principle, so callers with an operator-configured base URL should prefer
    that and treat this as the fallback. The value is only ever rendered back
    to an already-authenticated user for copy-paste, never used to make a
    server-side request.
