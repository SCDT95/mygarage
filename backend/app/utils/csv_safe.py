"""CSV formula-injection hardening.

Spreadsheet apps (Excel, LibreOffice, Google Sheets) treat a cell whose text
begins with ``=``, ``+``, ``-``, ``@``, or a leading tab/CR as a *formula*. An
attacker who can influence an exported string field (e.g. a device-supplied
LiveLink ``param_key``, a vehicle nickname, a vendor name) can smuggle a payload
like ``=cmd|'/c calc'!A1`` that executes when the victim opens the export.

The rule (plan §11-F, R1-F2): act only on ``str`` values -- numeric types are
written by ``csv.writer`` verbatim and cannot carry a formula. A string is
neutralised (prefixed with a single ``'``) only when it is non-empty, its first
character is one of the dangerous lead characters, AND it does not parse as a
number. That leaves genuine numeric strings like ``-12.5`` untouched (R5).
