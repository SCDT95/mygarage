"""Utility for auto-syncing engine-hours records from service and fuel records.

Parallel to :mod:`app.utils.odometer_sync`, with one deliberate divergence
(resolves R1-H2 from the hours-usage-model plan): a synced row is located by
SOURCE IDENTITY — ``fuel_record_id`` or ``service_visit_id`` — never by
``(vin, date)`` and never by parsing the ``[AUTO-SYNC ...]`` note marker. That
gives service-sourced rows a stable identity so they can be removed by FK
cascade (``ON DELETE CASCADE``) when their parent service visit is deleted,
rather than orphaning the way the odometer track does today.

The caller composes this into an outer transaction (the fuel/service create
and update flows), so both helpers accept a ``commit`` flag: ``True``
(default) commits and refreshes within its own unit of work; ``False`` only
flushes, so the row gets an id and any FK side effects are visible to
subsequent queries inside the same transaction, and the caller commits once
at the end — mirroring ``odometer_sync``'s ``commit`` flag.

    Behavior:
        - Locates any existing synced row by SOURCE IDENTITY (``fuel_record_id``
          when ``source_type == "fuel"``, ``service_visit_id`` when
          ``source_type == "service_visit"``) — never by ``(vin, date)`` and
          never by note-parsing. Raises ``ValueError`` for any other
          ``source_type``.
        - If ``engine_hours`` is ``None``: deletes the existing synced row (the
          reading was cleared on the source record) and returns ``None``. A
          no-op (no commit/flush) when no synced row exists.
        - If a synced row exists: updates its ``engine_hours``, ``date``,
          ``source``, and marker note in place — the SAME row, never a
          duplicate. The FK column that identified it is already correct and
          is left as-is.
        - If none exists: creates one with the matching FK column set
          (``fuel_record_id`` or ``service_visit_id``), ``source=source_type``,
          and note ``[AUTO-SYNC from {source_type} #{source_id}]``.
        - Manual rows (``source='manual'``, both FKs null) are never located by
          the source-identity lookup, so they are never touched — even when
          they share the same ``(vin, date)`` as a synced row.
        - Never writes ``vehicles.current_hours``. Latest hours is derived at
          read time from ``hours_records`` (see ``app.services.hours_service``)
          — there is no cache to keep consistent.

    Args:
        commit: When True (default) the helper commits and refreshes within
            its own unit of work. When False the caller is responsible for
            committing — the helper still flushes so the row gets an id and
            any FK side effects are visible to subsequent queries inside the
            same transaction.

    Returns:
        The created/updated ``HoursRecord``, or ``None`` when the row was
        deleted (or never existed) because ``engine_hours`` is ``None``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if ``source_type`` isn't ``"fuel"`` or ``"service_visit"``.
